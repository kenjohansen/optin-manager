## Current Focus

**ContactOptOut.jsx** - This component has relatively low coverage at 52.31% and is a critical user-facing component that needs robust testing. Focus on error handling and edge cases.

## Notes

- All tests should focus on component behavior rather than implementation details
- Mock API calls to simulate different scenarios (success and failure)
- Ensure that no mocked or placeholder data exists in the application
