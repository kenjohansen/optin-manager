## Implementation Priority

1. Core authentication and routing tests (App, ProtectedRoute, AdminLogin)
2. Key functionality tests (Dashboard, ContactDashboard, OptInSetup)
3. User management and customization tests
4. API utility tests
5. Remaining component tests

## Testing Approach

For each component, we should test:

1. Rendering without errors
2. User interactions (clicks, form submissions)
3. API interactions (mocked)
4. State changes
5. Error handling
6. Responsive behavior where applicable

## Test Setup Requirements

1. Add a test script to package.json
2. Create a test setup file for common test utilities
3. Set up mock handlers for API requests
