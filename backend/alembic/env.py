Alembic migration environment configuration for OptIn Manager database.

This module configures the Alembic migration environment for the OptIn Manager
database. It handles both online and offline migration modes, supports multiple
database backends (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production), and ensures
all models are properly tracked for schema migrations.
