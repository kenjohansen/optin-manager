class VerificationCode(Base):
    """
    SQLAlchemy model for verification code records.
    
    The VerificationCode model is a critical security and compliance component that
    manages the verification process for consent actions. Verification codes provide
    proof that the individual who claims to own a contact method (email/phone) actually
    has access to it, which is essential for establishing valid consent under regulations
    like GDPR and CCPA.
    
    This verification process helps prevent fraudulent opt-ins and unauthorized
    preference changes, protecting both users and the organization. It creates an
    audit trail that demonstrates the organization took reasonable steps to verify
    the identity of individuals before processing their consent.
    
    As noted in the memories, the Opt-Out workflow requires sending a verification
    code, verifying that code, and then allowing the user to manage their preferences.
    This ensures that only the actual owner of a contact method can modify consent
    settings associated with it.
    
    Attributes:
        id (str): Primary key (UUID as string) that uniquely identifies each
                verification code record for tracking and auditing.
        
        user_id (str): Foreign key to the contact record, linking this verification
                     code to a specific individual. This is essential for tracking
                     who the verification code was issued to.
        
        code (str): The actual verification code value that the user must provide
                  to prove their identity. This should be a secure, randomly
                  generated value of sufficient complexity.
        
        channel (str): The communication channel used to send the code (sms/email).
                     This is derived from the contact type and affects the format
                     and delivery method of the code.
        
        sent_to (str): The original recipient contact information (phone/email).
                     This may be stored in masked form for audit purposes while
                     protecting the actual contact details.
        
        expires_at (datetime): When the code will expire, which is essential for
                            security. Short expiration times reduce the window of
                            opportunity for unauthorized use.
        
        verified_at (datetime): Timestamp when the code was successfully verified,
                             providing an audit trail of when verification occurred.
        
        purpose (str): The specific purpose of this verification (opt-in/opt-out/etc),
                     which may affect how the verification is processed and recorded.
        
        status (str): Current status of the verification code (pending/verified/expired),
                    which prevents codes from being used multiple times or after expiration.
