A compliant SMS notification management system that handles opt-in/opt-out processes and message delivery while ensuring regulatory compliance and best practices.

### 2.3.1 Provider Credentials Management and Security

- The provider secrets vault key is managed using a hybrid approach:

### 2.4 Verification & Preferences Workflows

#### 2.4.1 Contact Self-Service (Opt-In/Opt-Out)
- A contact (user) visits the Preferences page (formerly Opt-Out page) to check or change their opt-in/out status for email or SMS.
- The contact enters their email or phone number.
- The backend sends a verification code to the entered contact info (email/SMS).
- The contact enters the received code on the Preferences page.
- If the code is correct, the user is granted access to view and update their opt-in/out preferences for all campaigns associated with their contact info.
- This workflow ensures only the owner of the email/phone can access or change preferences.

#### 2.4.2 Verbal Opt-In (Double Opt-In by Authorized User)
- A Sales or Marketing team member (authenticated user) receives a verbal opt-in from a customer.
- The team member enters the customerâ€™s email or phone and desired preferences into the system.
- The backend triggers a Double Opt-In:
    - Sends an email/SMS to the contact with: (a) the verbal authorization statement, (b) a link to the Preferences page, and (c) a verification code.
- The contact clicks the link to the Preferences page, which detects that the session is a Verbal Auth (because the user is logged in, or via a special link parameter).
- The contact enters the verification code (or requests a new one) to confirm their consent.
- The contact can then review and adjust their preferences as needed.

#### 2.4.3 Unified Preferences Page
- The Preferences page supports both workflows:
    - If there is **no authenticated user**, assume a contact is self-managing preferences (self-service).
    - If there **is an authenticated user**, assume this is a Verbal Auth/Double Opt-In flow.
- The page UI adapts to show the appropriate prompts and actions for each case.
- All verification codes are single-use, time-limited, and tracked for audit/compliance.

#### 2.4.4 Post-Verification Confirmation Messages
- After a contact has successfully verified their opt-in status, the system sends a confirmation SMS with the following elements:
  - Confirmation of successful opt-in
  - Company name identification
  - Description of message types they'll receive
  - HELP and STOP keyword instructions
  - Message and data rates disclaimer
  - Message frequency information
- Sample confirmation message template:
  ```
  Thank you for confirming your opt-in to {company_name} messages. You will now receive {message_types} from us. Reply HELP for assistance or STOP to unsubscribe at any time. Msg&data rates may apply. {frequency_info}
  ```
- HELP response message template:
  ```
  Thank you for contacting {company_name}. For assistance with your messaging preferences, please visit {preferences_url} or reply STOP to unsubscribe from all messages. Standard message & data rates may apply.
  ```
- STOP response message template:
  ```
  You have been unsubscribed from {company_name} messages. You will no longer receive SMS messages from this number. Reply HELP for help or visit {preferences_url} to manage your preferences.
  ```

    - Priority: ENV variable (`PROVIDER_VAULT_KEY`), HashiCorp Vault, K8s Secret, OS-protected file, fallback to project dir (dev only)
    - Linux: `/etc/optin-manager/provider_vault.key`, Windows: `%PROGRAMDATA%\OptInManager\provider_vault.key`
    - Never store key with vault file unless fallback is required (dev only, with warning)
    - Production deployments must use K8s Secret, Vault, or OS-protected file
    - Key rotation and audit trail supported
    - Rationale: separation of key and lock, compliance (SOC2/ISO27K), extensibility for cloud KMS/secret managers

- Admin UI for configuring branding (company name, privacy policy link, logo, colors)
- Admin UI for selecting email and SMS providers (e.g., AWS SES/SNS; extensible for others)
- Separate credential entry for email and SMS providers (access key, secret key, region, etc.)
- Credentials are stored securely in an **encrypted vault** (never in the main database, never in the frontend, never in plaintext after saving)
- **Vault Location:** `backend/vault/provider_secrets.vault` (encrypted, audit-ready, never committed to git)
- In production, may use Kubernetes Secrets or external Vault; in dev/testing, always use the local encrypted vault
- Admin UI shows only a "configured" status after save
- "Test Connection" feature for each provider to validate credentials from the UI
- Backend retrieves credentials from secure vault storage for sending email/SMS
- System is designed for future extensibility to support additional providers (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, etc.)
- **SQLite DB Location (dev):** `backend/optin_manager.db`

### 2.4 Security & Privacy
- Encrypted storage of phone numbers
- Role-based access control
- No sharing of user data with third parties
- Secure API endpoints
- Compliance with privacy regulations
