# OptIn Manager Implementation Plan

This implementation plan defines the phased delivery approach, feature scope, and accountability checkpoints for the OptIn Manager project. **No new features or scope changes will be added until Phase 1 is delivered.**

---

## Phase 1: Core SMS & Opt-In Management (MVP)
**Focus:** Basic SMS/email sending, consent management, compliance, and admin UI.

### Features
- Core backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations)
- User, consent, message, template, campaign, verification code models and CRUD APIs
- Identity verification flows for all consent changes
- Smart helper API (`send_with_consent`): consent-aware message delivery
- Default message templates (SMS/email) with opt-out/unsubscribe language
- Standard web forms (opt-in/opt-out)
- PII encryption at rest and in transit; masking in logs and UI
- Data retention policies and audit logging
- Basic admin interface (React) for managing users, consents, templates, and messages
- Unit and integration tests for all flows
- Secure, documented deployment (K8s, Helm, FluxCD, secrets, HA DB, backup/recovery)

### Success Criteria
- Successfully send and receive SMS/email
- Properly handle opt-in/opt-out requests
- Maintain compliance with regulations (GDPR, TCPA, CAN-SPAM, CASL)
- Basic web interface functionality
- API uptime > 99.9%
- Message delivery < 5 seconds

## Phase 2: Enhanced Messaging & Web Interface
**Focus:** Improved user experience, campaign management, and extensibility.

### Features
- Batch message support
- Advanced message/web form templates
- Status checking and webhooks

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features
**Focus:** Scale, advanced use cases, and enterprise integrations.

### Features
- Advanced campaign tools (A/B testing, AI-powered optimization)
- Extended channels (MMS, WhatsApp, Email fallback)
- Advanced analytics (custom reporting, predictive analytics)

---

## Accountability & Scope Management
- **Scope Lock:** No additional features or improvements will be added until Phase 1 is delivered.
- **Task Breakdown:** Each phase will be broken down into detailed tickets/tasks.
- **Progress Tracking:** Use a project board to monitor status and prevent scope creep.
- **Regular Reviews:** Scope only revisited after MVP is complete and delivered.
