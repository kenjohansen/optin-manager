# OptIn Manager Implementation Plan

This implementation plan defines the phased delivery approach, feature scope, and accountability checkpoints for the OptIn Manager project. **No new features or scope changes will be added until Phase 1 is delivered.**

---

**Code Quality and Definition of Done Standards:**
All implementation must adhere to the code quality standards and definition of done described at the end of this document. No feature is considered complete until these standards are met.

## Phase 1: Core SMS & Opt-In Management (MVP)
**Focus:** Basic SMS/email sending, consent management, compliance, and admin UI.

### Features
- Core backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations)
- User, consent, message, template, campaign, verification code models and CRUD APIs
- Identity verification flows for all consent changes
- Smart helper API (`send_with_consent`): consent-aware message delivery
- Default message templates (SMS/email) with opt-out/unsubscribe language
- Standard web forms (opt-in/opt-out)
- PII encryption at rest and in transit; masking in logs and UI
- Data retention policies and audit logging
- Basic admin interface (React) for managing users, consents, templates, and messages
- Unit and integration tests for all flows
- Secure, documented deployment (K8s, Helm, FluxCD, secrets, HA DB, backup/recovery)

### Success Criteria
- Successfully send and receive SMS/email
- Properly handle opt-in/opt-out requests
- Maintain compliance with regulations (GDPR, TCPA, CAN-SPAM, CASL)
- Basic web interface functionality
- API uptime > 99.9%
- Message delivery < 5 seconds

## Phase 2: Enhanced Messaging & Web Interface
**Focus:** Improved user experience, campaign management, and extensibility.

### Features
- Batch message support
- Advanced message/web form templates
- Status checking and webhooks
- Preference center UI
- Campaign creation/scheduling
- Enhanced analytics and reporting

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Focus:** Advanced functionality and integrations.

### Features
- Custom opt-in flows
- Fallback channels (email, etc.)
- Advanced templating
- Multi-language/localization support
- Advanced targeting, A/B testing, frequency controls
- CRM and external integrations
- Advanced analytics, predictive features

---

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features
**Focus:** Scale, advanced use cases, and enterprise integrations.

### Features
- Advanced campaign tools (A/B testing, AI-powered optimization)
- Extended channels (MMS, WhatsApp, Email fallback)
- Advanced analytics (custom reporting, predictive analytics)

## Accountability & Scope Management

---

## Code Quality and Definition of Done Standards

1. **File Comments & Licensing**
   - Every file must begin with a comment block explaining its purpose, copyright notice, and a reference to the MIT License under which the project is open-sourced.

2. **Docstrings**
   - Every public method, class, data structure, and enum must include a complete, automated docstring describing its behavior, parameters, and return values.

3. **SonarQube Compliance**
   - There must be no SonarQube warnings or errors. Any warning that must be suppressed must be suppressed locally and justified with a comment. Global suppressions are not permitted.

4. **Commented-Out Code**
   - Code must not be commented out unless there is a very good, documented reason for doing so.

These standards apply to all code and documentation in the OptIn Manager project and are required for acceptance of all deliverables.

---

- **Scope Lock:** No additional features or improvements will be added until Phase 1 is delivered.
- **Task Breakdown:** Each phase will be broken down into detailed tickets/tasks.
- **Progress Tracking:** Use a project board to monitor status and prevent scope creep.
- **Regular Reviews:** Scope only revisited after MVP is complete and delivered.
